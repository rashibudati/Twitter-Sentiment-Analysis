# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
CNN-LSTM model designed to analyse twitter statements. 

1. Download the dataset from [I'm an inline-style link ] (https://github.com/pmsosa/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/data/Sentiment%20Analysis%20Dataset.zip )

2. Download the GloVe from[I'm an inline-style link ] (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

Note: The code is based on the paper (Find the PDF file in the repository)which is designed to know the sentiment of twitter statements. The code is modified with different parameters. I did not find much diffference in both the cases. I tried the CNN-LSTM model. You can also try for LSTM-CNN model(file in the repository) and see if there is any difference in the accuracy. 

PS: The path has to be set according to your file name. The dataset and GloVe should be present in the same folder as all the other files.
